Practice (various topics)
-------------------------

1. How many four-digit numbers are divisible by both 3 and 7?

#. Across *all* numbers, what is the 1000th number divisible by both 3
   and 7 but not 21 or 9?

#. Write a code block that prints all the factors of a positive integer.

#. The digit 8 appears: once in 8, twice in 88, and twice
   in 828. Write a program to calculate the number of times the digit
   8 appears in numbers in the interval [1000, 9999].

#. Ask the user for an integer between 77 and 88 (inclusively); to get
   input from the user, you can use the basic python command raw
   input(). If they do, say "Thanks!" and finish. If they don't, then
   have the prompt repeated until they do.

Write a function to do each of the following:

3. Print "Nanga def?"

#. Calculate the geometric area of a rectangle from an input length and
   width.

#. Have the user input two numbers, an "x" value, and a "sigma" value
   (whose default is 1).  Calculate the value G(x, sigma), where G is
   Gaussian function.

#. Output +1 if an input number is even, -1 one if it is odd,
   0 if it is zero, and -7 if the number is not an int.
