#. Calculate the geometric area of a rectangle from an input length and
   width.

#. Have the user input two numbers, an "x" value, and a "sigma" value
   (whose default is 1).  Calculate the value G(x, sigma), where G is
   Gaussian function.

#. Output +1 if an input number is even, -1 one if it is odd,
   0 if it is zero, and -7 if the number is not an int.
