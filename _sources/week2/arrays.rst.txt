Translating Vectors and Matrices to Arrays
------------------------------------------

.. NTS:

   note that at the moment we are ignoring differences between row/col
   matrices?

Up to this point, we have discussed storing one value at a time in a
variable, translating scalar quantities to computational types like
int, float, bool and complex.  What about when we have algebraic
things like vectors and matrices?

Consider an example case of a velocity vector, which might be written
in a physics textbook as:
  
  :math:`\displaystyle \textbf{v}  = ( v_x, v_y, v_z )`

Sometimes different sets of indices are used, and this could also be
written using a common, and slightly more general, mathematical
notation as either:

  :math:`\displaystyle \textbf{v} = ( v_1, v_2, v_3 )~~~~~~{\rm
  or}~~~~~~\textbf{v} = ( v_0, v_1, v_2 )`

In each case, the *i*\th component is referenced as :math:`v_i`, with
allowed values of *i* determined by the length of the vector.

When we translate this to Python, we have all the same parts, but some
have slightly different names and we use just one, particular syntax.

The above vector :math:`\textbf{v}` is stored as an **array** ``v``;
there is no bold font or arrow we can use to denote it as a vector, we
just have to remember it or perhaps reflect it in the variable
name. Instead of "components", we refer to **elements** of ``v``, which
would be accessed as:

   ``v[0], v[1], v[2]``.

We still refer to **indices**, but since we don't have subscripts, we
put them in square brackets.  The indices are always numbers, counting
from zero, which is called **zero-based counting**.  (Note that
different programming languages have different counting systems; C and
C++ use zero-based counting, while Fortran, R and Matlab count from
one.) 

The index notation carries directly to mathematical matrices.  In
computing, these are just referred to as multidimensional arrays, or
more commonly just "arrays (in actual fact, a multidimensional array
is just an array whose elements are also arrays, an "array of arrays",
but that normally is not relevant when using them). All the above
notations and terms apply.  Matrices typically have multiple
dimensions and therefore multiple indices; these also translate
directly from subscripts in the mathematics to square brackets in
computing.  For example, the element in the first row and column of a
2-dimensional matrix :math:`\mathbf{A}` would be ``A[0, 0]``; the next
element in the column would be ``A[1, 0]``; etc.

The following table summarizes the translation from mathematical
vectors to computational arrays:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 25 5 30

     * - Math name 
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - Comp name
     * - vector
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - array
     * - component
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - element
     * - index
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - index
     * - subscript
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - square bracket, ``[ ]``
     * - *example:* :math:`~~\displaystyle x_0`
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - ``x[0]``
     * - *example:* :math:`~~\displaystyle M_{0,4}`
       - :math:`\rightarrow`
       - ``M[0,4]``

Thus, the array notation closely follows that of the
mathematics/physics communities, with some small notational
differences.  And, importantly, much of the *mathematics* for
computing with vectors will also translate directly into programs, as
well.

Creating arrays
###############

There are many ways to assign values to arrays in Python.  In each
case, when we create an array we need its define:

1. the **length** or **shape** (dimensions),

#. the type of its elements, and

#. initial values for all the elements, which may be altered later.
   This is called **initialization**.

Note that *all* elements of an array are of a single type (i.e., one
cannot mix floats and ints in an array); and to distinguish the issue
of element type from the array's own type, the former's type is
referring to as a **datatype** (or **dtype**, an abbreviation often
used in helpfiles).

The need to define both dimensions and element types matches both 

* formal mathematical correctness, such as stating:

  :math:`\textbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^4`; that is, **v** a vector
  contains 4 real numbers,

  :math:`\textbf{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{4\times4}`; that is, **g** is a
  4-by-4 matrix of real numbers,

  :math:`\textbf{c} \in \mathbb{C}^{2\times3}`; that is, **c** is a
  2-by-3 matrix of complex numbers,

  etc.

* and computational space requirements, so Python knows how much space
  to allocate (dimensionality determines number of total spots,
  and element datatype determines the size of each).
  
Here and below, whenever using arrays, we will be importing NumPy,
which contains most of the functions we will use.

* Most basically, one can make an array directly using the
  ``np.array()`` function::

    import numpy as np

    v = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    print(v)
    print(v[0])

  ``v`` contains three elements, and that the [0]th value is 4 (as
  expected).  We can also verify the type of both ``v`` and its
  elements (checking just one is enough, since all elements have the
  same dtype)::
  
    print("type of v:", type(v))
    print("type of an element of v:", type(v[0]))

  As we entered all integer values, the dtype of the elements is an
  integer, which is called ``int64`` in NumPy; the "64" refers to the
  number of bits used to store each value.  

  The other fundamental property of any array, as mentioned above, is
  its length or shape.  For this 1D array, we get all the information
  needed from Python's "len()" function::

    print("Length of v is:", len(v))

  If we wish to change any value in the array, that is done simply by
  assigning a new value there.  For example, after::

    v[1] = -100

  printing ``v`` yields::

    [   4 -100    6]

  If we try inputting a float value like this, Python will convert it
  to an int, because arrays only contain one type.  Thus::

    v[2] = 99.9999

  printing ``v`` yields::

    [   4 -100   99]

  One can make 2D (or higher dimensional) arrays in a similar way,
  explicitly stating each element one-by-one.  For example::

    sigma2 = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])

  (Firstly, comparing the use of square brackets with the 1D examples
  above might explain why multidimensional arrays are called "arrays
  of arrays".)  In this case the entered numbers appear to be from
  different sets (complex and integer), but as noted above, arrays
  have only a single dtype.  ``type(sigma2[0, 0])`` shows that the
  chosen type is ``complex``, the more "complicated" of the
  types. This is verified by checking the value of ``sigma2[0,0]``,
  which is ``0.+0.j``.

  To check the dimensions of the array, we can use NumPy's "shape()"
  function::

    print("The shape of sigma2 is:", np.shape(sigma2))

  Note that when np.shape() returns the shape of a multidimensional
  array, it does so as a collection of numbers in parentheses.  This
  is actually a new Python type that will be discussed later, but it
  is a good to think of the several numbers describing shape-- e.g.,
  here, ``(2, 2)``-- as a single object.  As knowing the shape of an
  array is a key part of using it, we will make much use of this
  function (and of "len()", which always returns a single value int).

* One useful family of arrays is 1D arrays with evenly spaced
  elements.  For example, when making plots, we might want evenly
  spaced values along the x-axis.  In general, these work by
  specifying a desired interval of values and then *either* the number
  of elements *N* in the array *or* the step-size interval between
  elements.

  - For ``np.arange()``, we specify the desired interval of values as
    ``[A, B)`` and the step size between elements. The usage for this
    function is shown from the top of its help doc-string
    (``np.arange?``):

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       Docstring:
       arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)
          
       Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

       Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``

    Thus, there is one *required* argument, the ``stop`` value, and we
    can choose to enter our own ``start`` and ``step`` (or use the
    default values, which the help file also lists as ``0`` and ``1``,
    respectively).  In each case, the number of elements *N* in the
    array is determined according to the following relation:

       ``N = int( (stop - start)/step )``

    .. code-block:: python

       D1 = np.arange(10)          # def: start = 0, step = 1
       D2 = np.arange(-4, 8)       # def: step = 1
       D3 = np.arange(-15, 15, 3) 

    These yield the following, respectively::

      [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
      [-4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7]
      [-15 -12  -9  -6  -3   0   3   6   9  12]

    Readers can verify that the expected values and number of elements
    occur in each case.  We highlight, however, that the single
    argument example ``np.arange(N)`` used to make ``D1`` is a very
    efficient way to generate all of the element indices in an array
    of length *N* (more on this soon).
    
  - ``np.linspace()`` is a similar function, but for it we specify the
    desired interval of values as ``[A, B]`` (doubly-inclusive!)  and
    the total number of elements; the step size will be calculated
    internally based on the following:

       ``step = (stop - start)/(N - 1)``

    .. code-block:: python

       L1 = np.linspace(10, 20)        # def: N = 50
       L2 = np.linspace(-2, 2, 11)

    These yield the following, respectively::

      [ 10.        ,  10.20408163,  10.40816327,  10.6122449 ,  10.81632653,
        11.02040816,  11.2244898 ,  11.42857143,  11.63265306,  11.83673469,
        12.04081633,  12.24489796,  12.44897959,  12.65306122,  12.85714286,
        13.06122449,  13.26530612,  13.46938776,  13.67346939,  13.87755102,
        14.08163265,  14.28571429,  14.48979592,  14.69387755,  14.89795918,
        15.10204082,  15.30612245,  15.51020408,  15.71428571,  15.91836735,
        16.12244898,  16.32653061,  16.53061224,  16.73469388,  16.93877551,
        17.14285714,  17.34693878,  17.55102041,  17.75510204,  17.95918367,
        18.16326531,  18.36734694,  18.57142857,  18.7755102 ,  18.97959184,
        19.18367347,  19.3877551 ,  19.59183673,  19.79591837,  20.        ]

      [-2. , -1.6, -1.2, -0.8, -0.4,  0. ,  0.4,  0.8,  1.2,  1.6,  2. ]

    Again, the reader can check the length of each array for expected
    behavior.  Looking at the above arrays, we might notice a looooot
    of significant digits in each of the ``L1`` elements.  While this
    may not matter (numbers are just numbers), in some cases one might
    prefer "cleaner" ``step`` sizes with fewer numbers of significant
    digits.  Looking at the formula for ``step`` with linspace,
    perhaps an odd number like 51 would provide such?  The reader can
    check this in this instance, and decided on preferred properties
    in other cases.

* As a final example of NumPy functionality to make arrays, we discuss
  ``np.zeros()``, which makes an array in any specified shape and
  whose elements are all zero (of a given type).

  When creating a 1D array of zeros, the shape is just the length of
  the array::

    Z  = np.zeros(5)                  # def: dtype=float
    Z2 = np.zeros(4, dtype=bool)
    Z3 = np.zeros(6, dtype=complex)

  which respectively yield::

    [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
    [False False False False]
    [ 0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j]

  In specifying a multidimensional array, the shape is a collection of
  numbers, and as noted above, we can group them in parentheses to
  pass them as a single argument::

    Z4 = np.zeros((5,2))              # def: dtype=float
    Z5 = np.zeros((3,4), dtype=bool)

  yielding::

    [[ 0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.]]

    [[False False False False]
     [False False False False]
     [False False False False]]

  If we had tried to pass the two dimensions without the parentheses,
  such as::

    Z4 = np.zeros(5,2)  

  then Python would interpret this as passing two separate arguments,
  the first a 1D shape and the second a dtype; since ``2`` is not a
  known type, the following error message would occur::

    TypeError: data type not understood

  Matrices with more than two dimension can be created in the same
  manner.  Since we don't have higher dimensional screens, though,
  they get displayed to the user as 2D "slices" of the full array::

    Z6 = np.zeros((2,2,3), dtype=int)
    
  yields::

    [[[0 0 0]
     [0 0 0]]

    [[0 0 0]
     [0 0 0]]]

  Why would we want an array of all zeros?  Well, it provides us an
  easy approach for initializing an array of arbitrary size quickly.
  We can then go through and reassign the values that we want. For
  example, we could reassign the elements in ``Z``::

    Z[0] = 0
    Z[1] = 1
    Z[2] = 4
    Z[3] = 9
    Z[4] = 16

  Well, in such a case as this, why not just use ``np.array()``?  

  The reason would be that many times we do not just have unrelated
  numbers that we are putting in an array-- *we have some kind of
  system or rule for them*.  Consider values just assigned to
  ``Z``. We can see a relation between index and the value, which we
  could write mathematically as this:

    :math:`\displaystyle Z_i = i^2, ~~{\rm for}~i=0,\dots,4.`

#. Make the following arrays with NumPy functions:

      verify its dimensions.

   #. An array ``A`` of integers in the range :math:`[0, 11]`.

   #. An array ``xint`` of integers in the range :math:`[-15, 15]`.

   #. An array ``xfl`` of 81 evenly spaced values in the range
      :math:`[0, 20]`.

#. Use ``for`` loops to make the following:

   i. :math:`~\displaystyle x_i = \log_{10}(i+1)`, for
      :math:`~\displaystyle i = 0, ..., 10`

   #. :math:`~\displaystyle y_n = \sqrt{4n}+1`, for

   #. :math:`~\displaystyle z_k = (3k + 4i)^3`, for
      :math:`~\displaystyle k \in [0, 20]`. Note that ``i`` in this
      expression is the imaginary number.

   #. Define an array ``flip`` as follows: ``flip[i]`` equals
      :math:`\displaystyle i^3` for even ``i`` and
      :math:`\displaystyle i^2` for odd ``i``, over the
      interval :math:`~\displaystyle 0\leq i < 20`

   #. An array ``zabs`` whose values are the absolute values of ``z``
      from the previous question.

      :math:`~\displaystyle i = 0, ..., 5;~ j = 0, ..., 4`

#. Use whatever seems best to make the following:

   i. An array ``t`` of *N = 25* evenly spaced values between [-10,
      10].

   #. Using the above result, :math:`~\displaystyle s_n = \sin(2\pi
      t_n)`, over the ``len(t)`` (i.e., over all the values in ``t``).

   #. Make sure your code answering the first two parts makes it easy
      to adjust the number of elements in ``t`` and have the number of
      elements in ``s`` adjust automatically.  Plot the results from
      above using, for example::

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        plt.plot(t, s)
        plt.show()

      Does your result look like what is expected?  What happens as
      you increase *N*?
