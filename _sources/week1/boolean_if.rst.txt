Boolean expressions
-------------------

We have already seen the "bool" type in Python, which has two (and
only two) members: ``True`` and ``False``.  Expressions producing
these values are called **Boolean expressions**, with the operators
involved called **Boolean operators**.

Relational operators
####################

One common type of Boolean expression is the family of **relational**
(or comparative) expressions, which check the truth/falsehood of
equalities and inequalities. It is in *this* context that we have the
"equals" operator, which is written as ``==``, which returns a bool.
The operator compares operands on each side, such as::

  4 == 5 

which returns ``False``.  Variables can be used on either side of the
equality, as long as they have been defined previously.  And again, we
distinguish the relational ``==`` (the True/False statement "A equals
B") from the assignment operator ``=`` (the declarative operation "A
is set to be B"), with the latter storing value on the computer for
later reference with a name label.  The following are all allowed::

  val = 5
  val == 5
  5 == val
  5 - val == 0
  0 == val - 5

After the first assignment operation, the three relational operations
would produce the identical ``True`` result.  Note the order of
operations in the last two lines: the subtractions are performed
*before* the equality; in more complicated logic statements,
parentheses may still be desired for clarity.

There are several standard relational operators, each taking two
operators.  Common ones are:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths:  15 35

     * - Symbol
       - Description
     * - ``==``
       - equal
     * - ``!=``
       - not equal
     * - ``>``, ``<``
       - greater than, less than
     * - ``>=``, ``<=``
       - greater than or equals, less than or equals

Note that the operands' type can also matter when performing
comparisons.  Consider the following examples (with results and notes
shown in comments to the right of each)::

  5 == 5.0               # True, even though the types differ
  3.2 % 1 == 1.2         # False, perhaps surprisingly (float round-off error)
  type(5) == int         # True
  val2 = 35.0            # assignment!
  val2 <= 50             # True
  type(val2) != bool     # True
  val2**0.5 - 5 < 1      # True
  3 + ( val2 > 0 )       # 4

Some things to note from those examples:

* One must be careful when comparing equality of floating point
  numbers.  The results of floating point calculations may be veeery
  close, say differing by :math:`< 10^{-15}`, but they are still
  different.

* The type names ``int``, ``float``, etc. are in fact their own type,
  which is named ``type`` (consistently or confusingly enough...).
  This can be useful to check and restrict inputs to a function or
  part of code, say if one wanted *only* integer values.

* The result of a Boolean expression can be used as a quantity itself:
  ``True`` is evaluated as 1, and ``False`` as 0.

* Again, in more complicated expressions, the use of parentheses can
  be vital to clarify desired order of operations (even if only for
  human reading).

There also can be complications based on type.  For example, this
expression::

  cval = 10-1j
  cval > 0

produces an error: ``TypeError: no ordering relation is defined for
complex numbers``.  That is, complex numbers cannot be used as
operands in such a relational expression.  However, this might also
mirror a mathematical problem with the expression, with it being an
ill-posed problem (would we want to test the real part, or just the
imaginary, or both? what would that mean?).  However, the problem can
be rephrased more meaningfully and tested successfully, for example::

  abs(cval) > 0          # True
  np.abs(cval) > 0       # True, using NumPy's absolute value function
  np.real(cval) > 0      # True, evaluating the real part of cval
  np.imag(cval) > 0      # False, evaluating the imaginary part of cval

.. note to self

   here or somewhere else, note about bools and typecasting: 
   bool( ... ) produces True for nonzero values and False for nonzero ones

Logic operators
###############

An additional family of Boolean expressions are the **logic
expressions**, with associated things like logic tables, set
comparison and Venn diagrams. **Logic operators** include ``and``,
``or`` and ``not``, whose names are self-descriptive. 

The ``and`` and ``or`` operators each take two operands (one preceding
and one following); ``not`` takes a single following argument and can
also be used as a function. Consider the following examples::

  True and True         # True
  True and False        # False
  False and False       # False
  True or False         # True
  not False             # True
  not(True or False)    # False
  not(True or True)     # False
  not True or True      # True

As usual, one must be careful with the order of operations-- compare
the difference in the result of the last two expressions above.  In
the final expression, the ``not`` operator acts before the ``or``, so
that ``not True`` evaluates first to ``False``, and the resulting
``False or True`` evaluates to True.

The logic and relational operators can be combined.  For example::

  not 3 == 5                # True
  not 3 != 5                # False
  10*7 == 70 and 12 == 28   # False

Conditionals: if, elif and else
-------------------------------

By default, the Python interpreter will move down the script file of
commands, executed each successive line until it reaches the end of
the file.  Thus, all commands would get executed, exactly once.

However, there might be occasions when we would like to have some
commands executed only in the case of a particular outcome.  Or,
perhaps we would like calculate a result, and depending on the
outcome, *just* execute some set A of commands, or another set B (or
aset C, or a set D, ...).  

That is, we use some result to decide what to do next.  For example,
if a result is less than 50, then double it; otherwise, leave it as
is. This kind of branching of command flow can be done using an
**conditional statement**.  This is perhaps where real, algorithmic
programming starts, beyond basic calculation, since the flow of
operations is result-dependent.

If statements
#############

There is a family of if statements, with related meaning and syntax.
We describe each briefly in turn.

In words, a basic "if" conditional statement can be expressed as, "If
some condition is met, then do this set of things."  This conditional
is translated into Python as::

  if <some condition> :
      <set of things>

There are several important things to note about this command and its
syntax (particularly as parts of this syntax are used in several other
Python tasks):

* ``if`` is a keyword in Python, that tells the interpreter that we
  are starting and if statement

* Next is a statement ("the predicate") that is treated as a Boolean
  expression: it is evaluated as either ``True`` or ``False``. Note
  that the statement may be complicated and contain several pieces
  (relational, comparative, etc.), but it is evaluated as a single
  ``True`` or ``False``.

* The line **must** end with the colon character ``:`` after the
  Boolean expression; it can basically be translated as the "then"
  in the verbal expresion.

* The line following the ``if`` statement **must** be indented
  relative to the ``if`` statement; **indentation** is the set of
  spaces at the start of the line.  The Python standard for
  indentation is 4 spaces.

* The ``<set of things>`` to be done if ``<some condition>`` is True
  may be one or more commands.  Each command to be done must be
  indented the same amount relative to the ``if`` statement.

* The Python interpreter knows that it has reached the end of the list
  of ``<set of things>`` to do when it either:
  
  1. Reaches a line that is *not* indented relative to the ``if``
     statement, or

  #. Reaches the end of file (EOF).

So, for example, the conditional, "If x is greater than 10, calculate
x-squared and print the result" could be translated as::

  if x > 10 :
      xsq = x*x
      print("x-squared is:", xsq)
  print("I am printing from *outside* the condition!")

(This assumes that ``x`` has been assigned a value previously.)  There
are two commands to be done if *x* is greater than ten, and Python
knows this because there are two indented lines.  The last ``print``
function is executed regardless of the value of ``x``, because it is
*outside* of the conditional; its lack of indentation relative to the
``if`` statement tell that to Python.  

Indentation may be made up of spaces and/or TABs.  However, for
portability to different computers and text editors, using *only*
spaces is highly preferred.  The standard indent size of 4 spaces has
been chosen to balance readability with space considerations.  On a
human level, Python's use of indentation here makes it easy to read
what is "inside" and "outside" of an ``if`` expression, especially as
the conditionals get larger and more complicated.

Some other examples of valid ``if`` conditions (assuming all variables
have been properly assigned values)::

  # Multiple pieces to a Boolean expression
  if 100 <= x and x < 1000 :
      print("Medium-sized x", x)

  # More than values can be tested
  if type(y) == int :
      print("Oh good, an integer value:", y)

  # Negation, and several things to do if True
  if not(type(y) == int) :
      print("Oh darn, a non-integer value:", y)
      y = int(y)
      print("Now I have *made* it an integer value:", y)
  print("Whether you wanted it or not, you have an int now!")

The following would be *invalid* ``if`` conditions::

  if 100 <= x and x < 1000 
      print("Medium-sized x", x)
  # --> Syntax Error: missing a colon after the predicate statement

  if 100 <= x and x < 1000 :
  print("Medium-sized x", x)
  # --> Indentation Error: missing indentation after the colon

**In summary**, the ``if`` conditional allows us to program the
following kinds of expressions, "If X is true, do Y," where X can be
as complicated a True/False statement as desired, and Y can be a list
of one or more commands.  Python demands certain syntax to be able to
interpret this, including the colon ``:`` at the end of the predicate
statement X and indentation of each of the conditional commands in Y.

If/else statements
##################

The above "if" conditional only provides commands for when a statement
is true.  The related "if/else" conditional adds the ability to
provide alternative commands if the predicate statement is false.
This can be referred to as "forked" decision making (like having to
choose between paths at a fork in the road).

Thus, the "if/else" conditional statement can be expressed as, "If
some condition is met, then do this set of things; otherwise, do this
*other* set of things." This conditional is translated into Python
as::

  if <some condition> :
      <set of things>
  else:
      <other set of things>

Note that all of the above rules for the ``if`` part apply, such as
the colon and indentation.  Additionally, the Python keyword ``else``
(the Python translation of "otherwise") is used in parallel to ``if``
and itself followed by a colon ``:``; both are necessary aspects of
the syntax.  Note that fact that ``else`` is not indented relative to
``if`` closes the ``<set of things>`` list.  The same rules apply for
the ``<other set of things>`` as for the set following ``if``: there
may be one or more, and all must be indented by the same amount
(standard, 4 spaces) relative to ``else``; Python again knows the end
of the ``else`` list of commands when the next line is not indented or
the file ends.

The following is an if/else example (based on some examples in the
``if`` section above):

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   if type(y) == int :
       print("Oh good, an integer value:", y)
   else:
       print("Oh darn, a non-integer value:", y)
       y = int(y)
       print("Now I have *made* it an integer value:", y)
   print("Whether you wanted it or not, you have an int now!")

The exclusive cases of whether ``y`` is or is not an int are now dealt
with in a single conditional.  The final ``print`` function is outside
of the conditional (which is signaled by its lack of indentation
relative to the ``if``\/``else`` keywords).  If ``y`` *is* an int,
then the commands in lines 2 and 7 are executed; otherwise, those in
lines 3-7 are executed.

Again, Python's use of indentation in conditionals provides a nice,
human-readable visual cue to check what is inside of a conditional
branch.  We can immediately tell that there is one command following
the ``if`` branch, and three commands following the ``else`` branch.

As another example, consider translating the following into a block of
Python code: "Let x be a number.  If it has 9 as a factor, print how
many times 9 goes into it; otherwise, just print the original number."

First, we have to translate the predicate into a mathematical Boolean
statement.  Well, factors divide evenly into a number, so our more
mathematical statement could be "Let x be a number.  If x divided by 9
has zero remainer, then ..., else ..." etc.  This is now something
that can be translated into Python code:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   if x % 9 == 0 :
      print("How many times does 9 go into x?", x/9)
   else:
      print("Sadly,", x, "does not have 9 as a factor").
      
The following are examples of *invalid* attempts to use if/else::

  if type(y) == int :
      print("Oh good, an integer value:", y)
      else:
          print("Oh darn, a non-integer value:", y)
          y = int(y)
          print("Now I have *made* it an integer value:", y)
  print("Whether you wanted it or not, you have an int now!")
  # --> Syntax Error: because the "else" does not parallel and "if"

  if type(y) == int :
      print("Oh good, an integer value:", y)
  else:
      print("Oh darn, a non-integer value:", y)
  y = int(y)
      print("Now I have *made* it an integer value:", y)
  print("Whether you wanted it or not, you have an int now!")
  # --> Indentation Error: the "y = int(y)" is actually not interpreted
  # as an error by Python, but the 'print("Now ...' line is detected 
  # as indented for no reason.

  if type(y) == int :
      print("Oh good, an integer value:", y)
  else:
      print("Oh darn, a non-integer value:", y)
      y = int(y)
  print("Now I have *made* it an integer value:", y)
  print("Whether you wanted it or not, you have an int now!")
  # --> Python finds no Error!  However, *we* would view this as a
  # programming mistake, because we wanted the 'print("Now ...' line 
  # to be inside the else branch.  Careful, things like this can be 
  # tricky to debug.

**In summary**, the ``if``\/``else`` conditional allows us to program
the following kinds of expressions, "If X is true, do Y; else, do Z."
The same rules as above apply to X and Y; Z also shares the same
indentation rules as Y, and the ``else`` line ends in a colon, just as
the ``if`` line does.  The "else" is logically parallel to the "if",
and in programming syntax this is mirrored by the fact that ``else``
has no indentation relative to the ``if``.

If/elif/else statements
########################

Finally, the above "branching" conditional can be generalized to test
more than one (exclusive) predicate statement, using one or more "else
if" lines.

Thus, the "if/elif/else" conditional statement can be expressed as,
"If some condition is met, then do this set of things; otherwise, if
this *other* condition is met, do this *other* set of things; otherwise,
do this last set of things." This conditional is translated into
Python as::

  if <some condition> :
      <set of things>
  elif <some other condition> :
      <other set of things>
  else:
      <last set of things>

All the same rules apply to the ``elif`` line as to the ``if``
line. Furthermore, note that we have only written one ``elif``
condition, but there can be as many as desired, and the same rules
apply to each.

For example:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   if dist_km > 500 :
       print("Far distance.  Looks like I'm flyin'!")
   elif  dist_km > 200 :
       print("Well, I will check a train schedule!")
   elif dist_km > 100 :
       print("Well, guess that's a bus ride.")
   else:
       print("Maybe my friend can drive.")

If ``dist_km`` there were, say, 1000, then each of those Boolean
expressions after ``if`` or ``elif`` is actually true; the order of
the statements matters, because each ``elif`` differentiates itself
from prior cases.  Swapping lines 3 and 5 would lead to different
outcomes (and likely incorrect ones).

First come up with what you think the answer *should* be, and then
check the result using an ipython terminal:

#. What are the differences in output of these?::
        
     False * True
     False and True

#. Fix the following::

     x = 3
     if x > 25
         print("This number is big!")

#. Fix the following::

     x = 3
     if x > 25
         print("This number is big!")
         else:
             print("This number is small!")

#. How many print statements get evaluated?::

     x = 3
     if x > 25:
         print("This number is big!")
         print("Where did you find it?")
     print(x)

#. How many print statements get evaluated?::

     x = 3
     if x > 25:
         print("This number is big!")
     elif x < 10:
         print("This number is small!")
     print(x)

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test1``
   is greater than 5.  If it is, print "Congratulations".

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test2``
   is odd.  If it is, print "I found an odd number"; otherwise,
   print "I found an even number".

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test3``
   is *not* an int.  If it is not, then print "Fancy number".
   Otherwise, do nothing.

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test4``
   is in the interval ``[-3, 3]``.  If it is, print "Small number!".
   If it outside that range but in the range ``[-10, 10]``, print
   "Medium number!"; and if it is outside of that range, print "Big
   number!"

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test5``
   is complex or a float.  If it is complex, print "I found a complex
   number"; if it is a float, print "I found a float"; otherwise,
   print "Oh well".

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test6``
   is a negative integer.  If it *is*, multiply it by ``-3`` and see
   if the result is a multiple of 9; if *that* is, then print "hello,
   my friend".  In any other case, print "Oh, no, not you".
