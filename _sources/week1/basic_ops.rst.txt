.. note:: Here and throughout, all commands in the light-green fields
          can be copied+pasted in a terminal where the ipython
          environment is running.  Readers are encouraged to follow
          along, and to ponder what the results should be in each case
          before running in an ``ipython`` environment or Jupyter
          Notebook.

Python as a calculator
----------------------

At its most basic Python can be used as a calculator, performing
basic mathematical operations, such as::

  4+8
  217.81 * 3
  18 * ( 29182 - 9382)
  - 305.8 / 21.1

etc.  Note that the spacing between the numbers and the operators does
not matter to the Python interpreter; however, it *is* important to
make the code readable to humans, so one should try to be consistent
in form.

Mathematical order of operations is maintained within the context of
evaluating expressions within parentheses first, and also evaluating
multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.  However,
the Python interpreter may not necessarily evaluate a set of
multiplications/divisions from left to right.  We will see why this
might matter shortly.

Python comes with many basic operations that we might expect: ``+, -,
/, *``, as well as parentheses ``(...)``.  Additional operators
include:

* raising to a power with ``**``, so that ``5**2`` raises squares
  five, returning 25;  fractional and negative powers may be used

* taking the modulus (i.e., finding the remainder of division) with
  ``%``, so that ``5 % 3`` returns the remainder of dividing five by
  three, returning 2.

Think about the results of each of the following, and then evaluate in
Python::

  3**2
  -3**2
  10**5
  9**0.5
  4**(-0.5)
  5 % 2
  25 % 5
  5 % 25

Consider the result of simple division: ``2.0/3.0``.  What is the
result?  Well, in mathematics it would be 0.66666666... with an
infinite number of decimal places.  However, the computer has finite
disk space and finite memory.  In general, we cannot expect the
computer to have an exact representation of such numbers, nor of
irrational (:math:`\sqrt{2}`, :math:`7^{1/3}`) and transcendental
numbers (:math:`\pi`, Euler's *e*, etc.).  

.. asdf
   Furthermore, in many
   regards we should treat carefully the idea of "exactness" with any
   decimal value resulting from calculations, and treat such numbers as
   approximate in essentially all cases.

Type
####

One question that might be asked is: what is the difference (if any)
between the following calculations:

.. code-block:: python

   3 * 4
   3.0 * 4.0

The answer to the first is ``12``, and the answer to the second is
``12.0``.  While these numbers have the same **value**, they do have
an important difference: the first is an integer, and the second is
a (rational) real number.

In many applications we may take for granted the mathematical sets
that numbers belong to, like integer (:math:`\mathbb{Z}`) or real
(:math:`\mathbb{R}`).  However, for programs *every* quantity and
object has a defined category (even non-mathematical objects), and
this fundamental property is called its **type**. There is a built-in
function in Python called ``type()``, and using it we can see that:
``type(12)`` is called "int", and ``type(12.0)`` is "float".

When performing calculations, we must consider *both* value and type
of the quantities involved. There are several types corresponding to
familiar number sets from mathematics.  In many cases the names are
similar, and when programming we should use the computational name for
clarity. There are some further considerations that must be made,
since computers are finite and cannot contain arbitrarily large
values.  Below are some examples of numerical types:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 35 15 50

     * - Math set
       - Comp type
       - examples
     * - Booleans
       - **bool**
       - ``False``, ``True`` (and only these!); or respectively:
         0, 1
     * - Integers (:math:`\mathbb{Z}`), up to certain size
       - **int**
       - 0, 21, -1000
     * - Integers (:math:`\mathbb{Z}`), up to arbitrary size (computer
         memory!) 
       - **long**
       - 0, :math:`2\times10^{19}`, :math:`-3\times10^{21}` 
     * - Real numbers (:math:`\mathbb{R}`)
       - **float**
       - 0., 21.32138, -1000.312
     * - Complex numbers (:math:`\mathbb{C}`)
       - **complex**
       - 0+0j, -3+2.4j, 400.5-1j

While the "type" property is analogous to the mathematical number set
designation, type is also closely related to purely computational
features.  For example, anything stored on a computer must occupy an
amount of hard disk or memory space, and each "type" has a certain
amount of space allocated.  Once a type is known, the correct amount
of space is allocated to fit a value.  (If the program tries to store
a value too large for the type's allocated space, an "overflow" error
occurs.)

Note the multiple types of integer-like quantities.  In many cases,
simple ints are large enough for quantities.  However, if the value
does grow too large for int, Python will automatically switch over to
storing with a long, and can store an integer up to the amount of
computer memory available (wow!).  This auto-switch behavior is *not*
general to programming in other languages, where programmers must
typically know the maximum size of numbers to expect to store; we
highly recommend that programmers also keep track of this in Python--
having approximate ideas of what the code *should* be doing is really
useful to finding+fixing bugs.  Python 3 will also have different
behavior-- it just has the int type, which can be as large as it
needs.  We will see some other variety of ints and floats based on
number size/computer space through the numpy module, and we will also
meet some other, non-numerical types below, as well.

When performing operations, what determines the type of the result?
In Python, it is generally the inputs (and occasionally the operator).
If all ints are used in an expression, the output is typically an int,
and similarly for floats, etc., as above.  

What happens when types are mixed?  Evaluating ``3.0 * 4`` yields
``12.0``, a float. Here, Python is performing ``type conversion``:
when mixing types in an expression, the result will be of the "most
general" type.  In this example, the more general type is floats (in
the sense that int values are a subset within floats).

                 order of operations:  copmlex nums, parenth
   add functions to do type conversion
   

Assignment
----------

The calculator functionality described above is useful at times, but
it is not *really* programming, since we cannot combine results of
different calculations and build on previous results, as values aren't
saved.

We now take a large step toward real programming by introducing
Python's **assignment operator** "=".  Thus, with::

  x = 4 + 8

we will have the result of a calculation (``12``) stored, which we can
access any time later by referring to ``x``.  For example::

  x = 4 + 8
  y = 10**3
  z = x*x - 10*y

The "=" in this context does *not* express mathematical equivalence (a
passive statement that is true or false, just expressing equality). We
*cannot* treat it like an alebraic expression and try rearrange the left
hand side (LHS) and right hand side (RHS) to be something like::

  x - 4 = 8

or anything like that (try it, Python will produce an
error). 

This operator "=" is an *action*, providing a reference label to a
value that is stored on the computer.  One can read it more like "*x*
is defined to be ...", etc.  As such, every quantity on the RHS must
be known and have a value already. Therefore, if ``c`` has not been
assigned a value previously, then::
    
  d = c*c - 10
  c = 4 + 8

will produce an error when evaluating the first line.  Consider the
expression::

  y = 3*x + 4.5

This is *not* a general relation, like the formula for a straight line
in mathematics.  This is a single instance, and a specific value for
"x" must have been defined previously. (The way to write a general
relation like the equation of a line is done by defining a function,
discussed later).

There is a careful ordering to how Python treats lines with the
assignment operator:

#. evaluate the RHS (if any term there has not been previously
   defined, an error occurs)

#. store the resulting value at some location on the computer (in an
   appropriate-sized space, based on the final type)

#. take the label the LHS and associate it with that location, so
   whenever that label occurs in an expression, Python will go the
   correct location and get the desired value.

The variable on the LHS of the assignment operator is, well,
*variable*, and its value (and/or type, in Python) can be changed
simply by assigning it to a new value at some point.  So, at the end
of these lines::
  
  x = 10
  x = -11.4
  x = False

there is still only one variable *x*, and it refers to a quantity of
type "bool" and value "False".

The Python command ``whos`` is a useful way to see what variables have
been defined in a Python environment.  It provides a list of the
variable names, their values, their type and other properties.

.. notes to add in

   In some programming languages (such as C), every variable must be
   given a type explicitly before use, a process called **declaration**.
   This basically sets out the storage space for a variable ahead of
   time, and a value can be filled in either then or afterwards.
   However, in Python this is not necessary-- the type of a variable is
   determined automatically when a value is assigned to is. Consider one
   example from above::
     
     x = 4 + 8
  

   3e-4 notation.... x10**...

Variable names
--------------

There are some rules for variable names to keep in mind.  They must be
made up only of *alphanumeric* characters, meaning:

* a-z
* A-Z
* 0-9

as well as the underscore "_". The variable cannot *start* with a
number, but the number may appear anywhere else.  Special character
such as ``\, $, %, !,`` etc. can\ *not* be used, nor can commas ``,``,
periods ``.`` or dashes ``-``, as those all have special other
meanings.  Spaces `` `` cannot be used, as those separate different
words.

Please do remember to make meaningful variable names.  For example, we
emphasize here translating mathematics/physics/etc. from paper
calculations to programs.  Therefore, you should employ the same
variable names and notations that you have written down to the program
you are writing.  For example, if writing the formula "distance equals
velocity times time", you should probably make use of the standard
variables::

  d = v * t

or perhaps more interpretable, but succinct, names::

  dist = vel * time

Half (or more!)  of the art of programming is to make the code itself
as readable and understandable as possible.  This makes the program
simpler to check by eye while writing and more directly editable at
future times.  It also greatly reduces the numbers of bugs or errors
in the code.

.. _basic_types:

Basic math types
----------------

The values stored on a computer take up physical space, in units of
*bytes* (= 8 bits; each bit is essentially one place in a binary
number).  How much space is set aside for a given quantity depends on
what is being stored, which is known as **type**.  The type of a
quantity must always known in order to store it.


In some programming languages (such as C), every variable must be
given a type explicitly before use, a process called **declaration**.
This basically sets out the storage space for a variable ahead of
time, and a value can be filled in either then or afterwards.
However, in Python this is not necessary-- the type of a variable is
determined automatically when a value is assigned to is. Consider one
example from above::

  x = 4 + 8

Here, 4 and 8 are both ints, so their sum is an int, and therefore
``x`` gets the type int (along with the value 12).  We can investigate
the type of any numerical object or variable in Python using the
type() function::

  type(x)
  type(45.7)
  type(103 - 32)

What happens if we add an int and a float, such as::

  x = 4 + 5.1

?  Well, check on your own computer, but the answer should be 9.1 and
the type should be float.  Python will "choose" the type where
information does not get lost.

Re. calcs with ints
###################

We saw above that the following kind of operation resulted in x being
itself an int::
  
  x = 5 + 2

What should happen here::

  x = 5 / 2

? Mathematically, we might expect to get 2.5, but this is *not* the
case in Python 2.7.  Since the numerator and denominator are both int,
the result will be int, and the operation performed is called
**integer division**.  This is also the way that the C language would
evaluate this result.  

While at first surprising, this is consistent with other usage and
operation we have seen.  If we wanted a floating point result, we could
rewrite the preceding case as, for example::

  x = 5. / 2

This is one reason why one must keep tract of the type of values used
in code-- one doesn't want to be *surprised* by integer division.  

However, this subtlety with division can sometimes lead to the
presence of bugs in a code, and often ones that are tricky to find.
For some people, it is so bothersome that they have decided to do away
with this behavior. *This has resulted in a major difference in
behavior in Python 3, where the "\/" operator will return floats, even
when the numerator and denominator are both ints.*

There is also explicitly an integer division operator "\/\/", which
exists in both Python 2.\* and Python 3.\*. It will always perform
integer division, regardless of the values used.  Note that if a float
is present in the operation, integer division is first performed and
then a float-ized version of the result is returned.  For
compatability between Python 2.\* and Python 3.\*, and also for
avoiding possible confusion in one's own code, **one should only use
the explicit operator "\/\/" for integer division.**


Re. calcs with floats
#####################

There are some caveats to keep in mind when using floats.  Firstly,
consider the result of::

  5. / 3

Mathematically, we would expect "five divided by three" (in the real
numbers) to yield :math:`1.6\bar{6}`, which trails on forever.
However, we can't store an infinite number of values, and the result
is truncated to the default precision of floats (around
:math:`10^{-16}`). This leads to floating point error in the result,
and means that with computers, we can often only have finite
approximations to what might be infinitely-precise mathematical
results-- an important difference!

Secondly, floating point error may also appear in other, perhaps
unlikely, places.  The "\%" operator returns the remainder of
division.  With integers, we might get expected results, from say::
  
  5 % 2
  9 % 3
  21 % 6

However, what about::
  
  5.2 % 2
  (5.2 % 2) - 1.2

?  On my system at least, the answer to the first comes up as
1.2000000000000002 and the second as 2.220446049250313e-16; it might be
slightly different on yours, but the main feature is that it might not
be exactly the analytical result of "1.2".  (If you *don't* have a lot
of decimal places in your result, fine, but there are analogous
examples of where this would happen on your computer-- and that is
just the point, that this floating point precision error is not
predictable in general.) Having a result in the second line that is
*nearly* zero may be OK for some calculations, but might be
catastrophic for others (say, if the result is multiplied by
:math:`10^{20}`, and the result is far from zero for further
calculations).  This all emphasizes the general points that:

i. **floating point results may have small precision errors, making
   tests of exact equality difficult if not impossible with floats;**

#. **differences involving the results of floating point arithmetic
   may lead to tiny rounding errors instead of an exact zero, which
   may lead to problems in further calculations.**  

Computers are useful, but they must be used with care!
