Modules

:ref:`We have already seen <week1_basic_ops>` how lots of very basic
mathematical operators are directly available in Python.  But we would
also like to be able to do further things, like calculate sinusoids,
exponentials and logarithms; generate random numbers from many
different distributions; perform image processing; plot results; and
many other things.  While it is true we could write our own functions
to do these things (and sometimes we might), in general we can avoid
"reinventing the wheel" and spend our time addressing other questions,
by importing **modules**.

Modules are sets of code that contain sets of functions, constants and
other objects, generally organized around a given topic.  By
**importing** a module, we mean that we make that modules
functionality available for our given program or session. Once the
module file has been imported, it is just as if its code had been
included at that point in the main code. We can think of importing a
module like going to a library and picking out a book on statistics
for probability distributions, a book of algebra for matrix
operations, etc.

As with books, sometimes there are overlaps of functionality among
modules.  Also as with books, we like to cite where things come from
for easy reference, understanding by both ourselves and others.  Both
of these factors influence the way in which we import modules.

Importing a module
##################

There are different ways to import modules (or even just pieces of
modules).  In general, we strongly prefer the following method and
will typically use it here::

  import <MODULE_NAME> as <ABBREVIATION>

The abbreviation will be chosen to be unique for each module, and it
is included every time we use part of the module.  In this way, it
acts as a reference citation both for ourselves and for others.  It
also helps avoid problems of conflicts if, for example, two modules
contain a function of the same name.

For example, one of the most common modules we will make use of is
NumPy (`link <http://www.numpy.org/>`_), which contains arrays and many
associated linear algebra operations; trigonometric and hyperbolic
functions; random number generators; and many other tools.  The
standard import and abbreviation are::

  import numpy as np

Once this is done, to use any function or assignment within numpy, we
just type things like::
  
  np.sin(10)
  x = np.exp(-3.5)
  y = np.log(x)
  np.log(10**7)
  print("the value of PI is:", np.pi)

\.\.\. and *many* more.

Some large modules even contain submodules for specific topics. We can
import the submodule in just the same manner as the full module,
providing it its own abbreviation.  For example, we will often use the
"pyplot" submodule of Matplotlib::

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Again, functions within the (sub)module are just used in the same
manner as before::

  plt.plot(x, y)
  plt.hist(A)

etc.

A basic set of modules
######################

In this course, we will use the following modules.  Again, this is a
tiny set in an increasing set of modules available within the Python
community.

         charts, image processing, interactive plots

More with modules
#################

**How can we tell what functionality is available in a module?** We
can

* read the `online documentation
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html>`_,

* type ``np.`` and hit ``TAB`` to see a list of all objects in the
  module (yes, TAB-autocompletion is useful here, too!)

* guess a name and try typing it after ``np.``. Mmany module function
  names are the same as known mathematical functions (e.g., sin(),
  cos(), arctan(), tanh(), etc.) or variations (e.g., log(), log10(),
  log2(), etc.), and TAB-autocompletion might help show options when
  we have typed part of a known name

* search online for name of the function

Similarly, **how can we find what module a desired function is located
in?**  We can

* know from experience as we program

* note the abbreviation prefixing the function's name in a code, and
  check the ``import`` statement

* search online, such as "Python module binomial distribution" or,
  more generally, "Python module <FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION>".

Additionally, we can write our *own* modules to help us organize our
work.  A module can be as simple as a text file with function
definitions, parameter assignments and objects of interest, which we
would import in a similar manner (and still making an abbreviation for
each one). Making our own modules odules allow us to write code, and
separate it out from other code into a different file. This style of
programming-- having distinct pieces for specific jobs, which are then
later combined-- is referred to as **modular programming**, and it is
a very efficient model for being able to read, test and verify small
pieces, before combining them into the final product.

We can use the import statement to include the code of another file,
either in the current directory or in Python's search path.  For
example, if have some functions defined in a file called
"lib_astro_functions.py" (and it is either in the present working
directory or in Python's search path), we can put this in our main
code::

  import lib_project as lp

and then use functions from it by prefixing them with ``lp.``.  (In
the case of self-written modules, we likely have to make up our own
abbreviation, and the above was just chosen from the initials of the
file name.)

Rather than have one really big book of all of mathematics and
mathematical sciences, it is useful to keep different areas
compartmentalized for ease of reference and use.  The same is true of
programming: we don't want a single, huge file that is hard to search
through or to check individual pieces of. Modularization makes
programming more manageable.


.. notes to self:

   need comments on downloading/installing modules, if not already in
   existence; 
   + can give example for ubuntu package manager:
        sudo apt-get install python-numpy
   + probably, under "setup", we should have a separate page on installing
     things for this set of webpages;  list modules we will use, include
     commands, again I would suggest for Ubuntu
