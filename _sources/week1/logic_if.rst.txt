Practice

First come up with what you think the answer *should* be, and then
check the result using an ipython terminal:

#. What are the differences in output of these?::
        
     False * True
     False and True

#. Fix the following::

     x = 3
     if x > 25
         print("This number is big!")

#. Fix the following::

     x = 3
     if x > 25
         print("This number is big!")
         else:
             print("This number is small!")

#. How many print statements get evaluated?::

     x = 3
     if x > 25:
         print("This number is big!")
         print("Where did you find it?")
     print(x)

#. How many print statements get evaluated?::

     x = 3
     if x > 25:
         print("This number is big!")
     elif x < 10:
         print("This number is small!")
     print(x)

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test1``
   is greater than 5.  If it is, print "Congratulations".

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test2``
   is odd.  If it is, print "I found an odd number"; otherwise,
   print "I found an even number".

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test3``
   is *not* an int.  If it is not, then print "Fancy number".
   Otherwise, do nothing.

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test4``
   is in the interval ``[-3, 3]``.  If it is, print "Small number!".
   If it outside that range but in the range ``[-10, 10]``, print
   "Medium number!"; and if it is outside of that range, print "Big
   number!"

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test5``
   is complex or a float.  If it is complex, print "I found a complex
   number"; if it is a float, print "I found a float"; otherwise,
   print "Oh well".

#. Write an ``if`` condition to check if a variable called ``test6``
   is a negative integer.  If it *is*, multiply it by ``-3`` and see
   if the result is a multiple of 9; if *that* is, then print "hello,
   my friend".  In any other case, print "Oh, no, not you".
