    * course/webpage organization: go through several main
      features/topics, to be familiar with basics of each and how they
      interact, and then revisit each one later in more detail.  Iterating
      between practice <-> theory.

    * note about copy+pasting from green terminals, thinking about
      beforehand.

    * several practice examples for users, with expandable answers to
      self-quiz throughout.  If something doesn't make sense, ponder more
      about about, discuss with others and ask a question!
