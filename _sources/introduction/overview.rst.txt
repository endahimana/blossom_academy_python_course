* course/webpage organization: go through several main
  features/topics, to be familiar with basics of each and how they
  interact, and then revisit each one later in more detail.  Iterating
  between practice <-> theory.

* note about copy+pasting from green terminals, thinking about
  beforehand.

* several practice examples for users, with expandable answers to
  self-quiz throughout.  If something doesn't make sense, ponder more
  about about, discuss with others and ask a question!
